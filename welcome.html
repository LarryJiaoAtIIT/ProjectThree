		<h2 class="headline">Food Science Club aims to investigate, educate about our food</h2>
		<p class="preview">Luciano Pavarotti once said, “One of very nicest things about life is the way we must regularly stop whatever it is we are doing and devote our attention to eating.” But how many times do we stop to wonder what it is that we are eating exactly? Every 35 days your skin replaces itself, every month your liver replaces itself, your body makes these new cells from the food you eat. What you eat literally becomes you. Hence, understanding your food is extremely important. That’s exactly what the Food Science Club aims to do. With a diverse array of events and activities, we not just plan on educating you about your food, but also make sure you have fun while doing it.</p>
